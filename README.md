### Part 1: Setting Up TradingView Alerts

1.  **Create or Identify Your Trading Strategy**: Before setting up alerts, you need a clear trading strategy on TradingView that defines when to buy or sell.
    
2.  **Configure Alerts**: Once your strategy is in place, you'll set up alerts in TradingView that trigger based on your strategy's conditions.
    
    -   Go to the chart where your strategy is applied.
    -   Click on the `Alert` button on the upper right side of the screen.
    -   Set the condition that matches your entry or exit strategy.
    -   In the alert action settings, choose `Webhook URL` and enter your webhook URL formatted as `https://sc.oc.aliases.me/sc/mt5id`, replacing `mt5id` with your actual MT5 account ID.
3.  **Webhook Message**: In the `Message` field of the alert, enter the syntax for your trading signal. For example:
    
    perlCopy code
    
    `Sell,XAUUSD,open,high,low,close,no,RR,riskeachtrade,lotsize,licenseid` 
    
    Replace `Sell` with `Buy` as per your alert conditions and fill in the respective fields like `RR`, `riskeachtrade`, `lotsize`, and `licenseid` according to your strategy and risk management.
    
4.  **Save the Alert**: Once configured, save the alert. It will now trigger according to the set conditions and send signals to the specified webhook URL.
    

### Part 2: EA Setup in MT5

To configure your EA to accept and act on the signals received from TradingView, follow these steps:

1.  **Installing Your EA**: Start by adding your EA to the MT5 platform.
    
    -   Copy your EA file to the `MQL5/Experts` directory of your MT5 terminal.
    -   Restart MT5 or refresh the `Navigator` panel to see your EA listed.
2.  **Configuring Trade Settings**:
    
    -   Drag and drop the EA onto the chart you wish to trade.
    -   In the `Input` tab of the EA settings, you'll find various parameters you can set. If you prefer to use the risk settings from the remote signal, leave the `riskPerTrade` input empty. Otherwise, you can set a specific risk amount or percentage here.
3.  **Adjusting Risk Management and License Settings**:
    
    -   Set the `MaxTradesPerSymbol`, `RiskReward`, `stlSpread`, and other trade management settings as per your requirement.
    -   Input your `LicenseId` to ensure the EA operates based on your subscription or license terms.
4.  **Telegram & Alert Settings**:
    
    -   If you wish to receive notifications about trades via Telegram, provide your Telegram Bot Token and Chat ID, and enable the option by setting `InpTelegramEnable` to `true`.
5.  **Debug & Logs**:
    
    -   Enable or disable hotkeys and debugging logs based on your preference. These are helpful for monitoring EA activities and troubleshooting.
6.  **Review and Start the EA**:
    
    -   Go through all the settings once more to ensure they are configured as per your strategy and risk management preferences.
    -   Click `OK` to start the EA. It will now listen for signals from TradingView and execute trades based on the received instructions.
